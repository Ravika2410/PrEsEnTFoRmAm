            Thank you mam for being a part of my life. You are one of those teachers who always
            encourages me to do and try new things. From the very beginning of my life, I have
            face various types of discriminations in school as well as among my friends in my 
            area. In school, various teachers only help those students who have a fair skin or 
            simply I say I have been a part of racial discrimination.<br></font>
            <font face=TimesNewRoman size="30" color="indigo" >
            Every year of my schooling, I face a teacher who have a grudge against me and the 
            grudges that they are having that why I was securing second position in the class?
            and when I was standing near them with my medal and ceritificate they ask me in a
            shocking way that why I received the medal? <br> </font>
            <font face=TimesNewRoman size="30" color="red" >
            When they say these things, I will sometimes get hardly demotivated and ask myself that 
            I am that useless. But now it becomes a part of my life. I know I have to face these 
            type of people in my rest of my life. But it is said that when one bad thing happens,
            several good things will also happens. This a true statement for me because in a year,
            one to two teachers always against me but three to five teachers always encourages me 
            in which you are one of them.For this, I would like to say THANK YOU to the WhiteHatJr. 
            team as well who make me as your student.
